# LSTM

## Overview
Use the fear and greed index and closing prices to build and evaluate a LSTM to determine which is a better signal for cryptocurrencies.

-----
## Evaluation

1. Which model has a lower loss?
    
    * The closing prices give a lower loss.

2.  Which model tracks values better over time?

    *  Closing prices tracks better

3. Best window size?

    * Depends. Shorter for greater accuracy of price. Larger for trend.
